      <h1>ARTIST STATEMENT</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my site. I hope you enjoy viewing the photos as much as I enjoy creating them. Photography is the way to express myself, to develop my vision and to deliver it to the viewer. I invite you to explore, feel and dream with me, through my lens and perception. Every time during the photo creation process, I keep asking myself – what is the reality? Does it even exist? I believe we, as human beings, can only see a filtered reality, our own little world. Every small world is beautiful in something, is perfect to some extent. And so my art is a way to share a bit of my world with you.</p>
       
      <div class="row">
          <div class="learn-col">
              <h3>PHOTOGRAPHY CHEAT SHEETS</h3>
              <p>People often ask me about some tips and tricks, but it always confuses me. There are so many articles, tutorials, videos, everything on the internet. Why would yet one more advice matter? And then I’ve got one little idea, and it turned into the Improve Photography section.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="learn-col">
              <h3>WHY IS IT HARD TO LEARN PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
              <p>The internet is full of learning material, and one can find things to read and learn. But still, people ask for advice all the time. Why is that? One day I wanted to learn a new trick in Photoshop. I have found a video, watched it, tried that method and… forgot how to do it the next day. Should I look at it again? Or make notes? How to remember? Also, the abundance of information can, in fact, be a problem. People just get lost in the sea of information, and nothing stays in their minds, souls, and memory cards.</p>
   </div>
          <div class="learn-col">
              <h3>IMPROVE PHOTOGRAPHY VISUAL POCKET CARDS</h3>
              <p>So my idea is to create a series of simple digestive visual tips, similar to infographics, that people could upload to their phoneы or even print and take with themselves as a reminder or a cheat sheet. 

I will try to keep the info as simple as possible, as lightweight as possible and also each card will focus on a single aspect of photography to make it easy to understand and refer to. They should also be self-explanatory with no additional clarifications. With all this said, you can clearly see it’s not a simple task to do. And my first attempt on the subject proved me right. Infographics is a completely separate and a new skill to learn and to master (someday).

I hope it will be helpful for someone and I will keep adding things over tiection</p>

            <h3>Digital SLR Cameras</h3>
            <p>DSLR (or digital single lens reflex) cameras take photos to the next level of image quality. This more “serious” type of camera is best known for delivering remarkably sharp and spectacular images. It produces beautiful background bokeh, and even high resolution videos with the help of their advanced sensors, manual settings, and wide range of interchangeable lenses.</p>

        <div class="cameras-col">
            <img src="images/Medium Format Cameras.png">
            <h3>Medium Format Cameras</h3>
            <p>Medium format cameras, which, in general, have sensor sizes that are smaller than film medium format. However, medium format sensor size is larger than a full frame sensor, which generally translates to higher quality images.</p>

        <div class="cameras-col">
            <img src="images/360 Cameras.png">
            <h3>360 Cameras</h3>
            <p>The 360-degree camera takes half dome to full-circle panoramic photos and videos using back-to-back lenses. Like action cameras, some of them are also water resistant and mountable on many surfaces, such as on top of cars, helmets, or drones. Above all, they take the most realistic pictures and videos with stunning panoramic views that you can truly immerse yourself in, virtual reality style.</p>
